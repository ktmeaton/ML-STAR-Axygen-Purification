Custom labware creation:
    - 96 well plate on top of magnetic rack
    - pipetting and plate transport

Liquid detection:

Liquid transfer (stock tube to plate)
    - Aspirate from a single reagent tube (50 mL falcon), dispense to plate wells equivalent to number of samples.
    - I achieve this by writing loops, and manipulating the channel pattern string
